### Overview  

This repository summarizes my work during the **second semester** of the **Master MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Learning)** program at **ENS Paris-Saclay**.  
Semester 2 focuses on **advanced topics in generative modeling, optimal transport, and kernel-based learning**, combining mathematical rigor, algorithmic implementation, and applied research.

Each course involved theoretical lectures and a **final project or challenge**, often linked to real-world datasets or research-oriented problems.

### Highlights by Course  

#### **Data Generation in AI through Transport and Denoising** ‚Äî St√©phane Mallat (Coll√®ge de France)  
A deep dive into **transport and diffusion processes** for data generation.  
Our project on *EchoCem*, tackled **ultrasonic image segmentation** for cement integrity assessment (in partnership with **Schlumberger**), winning **1st place** in the Coll√®ge de France Data Challenge 2025.

#### **Kernel Methods for Machine Learning** ‚Äî Julien Mairal  
Applied **kernel learning** to a **biological sequence classification** problem on Kaggle: predicting transcription-factor binding sites from DNA sequences.  
Developed custom **spectrum** and **weighted-degree kernels**, validating theoretical principles from RKHS on real genomic data.

#### **Generative Modelling for Images** ‚Äî Bruno Galerne & Arthur Leclaire  
Reimplemented **Monotone Gradient Networks (MGNs)** to learn gradients of convex functions for **optimal transport-based image generation**.  
Demonstrated applications to **image synthesis, colorization, and domain transfer**, connecting convex optimization to generative learning.

#### **Optimal Transport** ‚Äî Gabriel Peyr√©  
Attended the full lecture series on **Optimal Transport theory and algorithms**, covering Wasserstein geometry, Sinkhorn distances, entropic regularization, and transport in deep learning.  
Although I could not attend the evaluation (schedule conflict), this course **laid the theoretical foundation** for my **Master Thesis and a forthcoming research article** on transport-based generative modeling.

### Research Impact  

This semester was central to defining the mathematical and computational basis of my **Master Thesis**, focused on **generative modeling through convex potentials and optimal transport**.  
The **Optimal Transport** and **Generative Modeling** courses directly inspired the **theoretical formulation and algorithmic design** of my research work.
