### Course Overview  

From the [Coll√®ge de France course page](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/cours/generation-de-donnees-en-ia-par-transport-et-debruitage):  

> *‚ÄúThe generation of data in AI is modeled as the transport of a Gaussian noise toward the observed data distribution.  
> The course studies how deep neural networks learn this transport through denoising and diffusion equations,  
> with links to optimal transport, Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equations, and the Schr√∂dinger bridge.‚Äù*  

Key topics:  
- Optimal transport and Wasserstein geometry  
- Score-based diffusion and stochastic sampling  
- Denoising and Langevin dynamics  
- Schr√∂dinger bridges and regularized OT  
- Industrial and scientific data challenges applying these principles

### Final Project ‚Äî *EchoCem: Ultrasonic Image Segmentation for Cement Quality Assessment*  

**Authors:** Thomas Gravier & Laura Choquet  
**Title:** *EchoCem ‚Äî Evaluation of Well Cement Quality through Ultrasonic Image Segmentation*  
**Result:** ü•á *1st place overall (Coll√®ge de France Data Challenge 2025)*

### Challenge Description  

The **EchoCem challenge**, organized in collaboration with **Schlumberger (SLB)**, focused on evaluating the quality of well cement integrity from **ultrasonic imaging data**.  
The goal was to **segment the key interfaces** ‚Äî the *casing*, the *cement*, and the *Third Interface Echo (TIE)* ‚Äî to assess the structural stability of oil and gas wells.  

This segmentation problem is challenging due to:  
- Heavy **sensor noise** and low contrast,  
- **Highly unbalanced classes** (dominant background),  
- **Poorly defined interfaces** between geological layers.  

Our task was to develop a model capable of segmenting these ultrasonic images with high precision and robustness across multiple well types.

### Methodology  

We explored several approaches before converging on a **deep learning architecture** optimized for segmentation tasks:  

1. **Baseline:** Classical image analysis and Random Forest segmentation.  
2. **Main Model:**  
   - Implemented a **U-Net architecture** with a **ResNet-34 encoder** pre-trained on ImageNet.  
   - Used **Focal Dice Loss** to handle class imbalance.  
   - Applied extensive **data augmentation** (rotation, flipping, Gaussian noise, affine transforms).  
3. **Post-Processing Improvements:**  
   - Morphological filtering and component-based corrections.  
   - A **secondary U-Net** trained for automatic post-processing, improving IoU by +1%.

### Experimental Results  

| Model | Validation IoU | Public Leaderboard | Private Leaderboard | Rank |
|--------|----------------:|------------------:|-------------------:|------:|
| Benchmark | 0.41 | 0.43 | 0.40 | ‚Äî |
| Baseline (Random Forest) | 0.52 | 0.55 | 0.53 | ‚Äî |
| **U-Net (ResNet34 backbone)** | 0.67 | **0.6821** | **0.6818** | ü•á **1st / 20+ teams** |

‚û°Ô∏è Our model ranked **first on both public and private leaderboards**, demonstrating **excellent generalization** and **robust segmentation**.

### Analysis and Discussion  

- The **transfer learning** strategy reduced overfitting given the limited dataset size (‚âà 4,400 labeled images).  
- **Data augmentation** was crucial for learning invariant representations across noisy samples.  
- The **hybrid post-processing U-Net** effectively corrected systematic segmentation errors.  
- Our final pipeline was **computationally efficient** and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the challenge dataset.

### Conclusion  

This project demonstrates how **deep learning and signal processing** can be combined to tackle complex **industrial imaging problems**.  
The use of **transport-based intuition** (from the course) and **denoising principles** (from Mallat‚Äôs lectures) provided a robust theoretical grounding for the approach.  

Our model outperformed all other submissions in the **Coll√®ge de France EchoCem Challenge (2025)**, highlighting the power of hybrid architectures and careful data processing for scientific imaging applications.
