## Course: Advanced Learning for Text and Graph Data (ALTEGRAD)

### Course Context

- This course is part of the **Master MVA** curriculum (M2 level).  
- It carries **5 ECTS** and includes **28 hours** of lectures and practical sessions.  
- The course provides a modern overview of **machine learning and deep learning for text and graph data**, combining theoretical insights with hands-on implementations.  
- Evaluation is based on lab assignments and a **final data challenge / project**.  

I achieved a grade of **17.23 / 20**, reflecting a strong understanding and implementation of the covered concepts.

### Contents & Themes Covered

Through the sequence of lab sessions (TP1–TP7) and the final project, the following topics are explored:

1. **Text processing & embeddings**  
   - Word and document embeddings (Word2Vec, TF-IDF, contextual models)  
   - Representing text as graphs (graph-of-words, semantic relations)

2. **Graph theory & spectral methods**  
   - Graph Laplacians, spectral clustering, graph similarity  
   - Graph kernels and community detection  

3. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**  
   - GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT (attention-based)  
   - Message passing, node classification, link prediction  

4. **Generative and probabilistic models on graphs**  
   - Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)  
   - Graph generation techniques  

5. **Self-supervised and contrastive learning on graphs**  
   - Multi-view contrastive setups  
   - Masked node/edge prediction  

6. **Integrating text and graph modalities**  
   - Learning on text-attributed graphs  
   - Combining LMs (language models) with graph structures  

7. **Scalability and practical aspects**  
   - Handling large-scale graphs  
   - Sparse representations and efficient batching  

8. **Final Project – Graph Generation with specified properties** 
 
   The final project focuses on **generating graphs with specified properties** using a **conditional diffusion model** combined with a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**.  
   The work includes methodology, experiments, evaluations, and a presentation summarizing results.
   Our approach achieved the **3rd best performance** across all teams from leading institutions, demonstrating both innovation and strong technical implementation.
